# The RAG Safety Theater Gap

## Core Finding
Default Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) systems reduce verification friction faster than they reduce risk.

## Quiet Failure
Retrieval is correct, synthesis is wrong, citation is real.

## Result
Risk propagates silently.

## Conclusion
RAG without causal human closure is inadmissible for high‑stakes use.
