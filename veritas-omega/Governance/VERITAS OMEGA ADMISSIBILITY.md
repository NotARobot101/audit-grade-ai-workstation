# ADMISSIBILITY BEFORE DEPLOYMENT
## A Framework for Preventing Unpriced Irreversible Harm

**Version:** v5.0  
**Status:** Public, Frozen  
**Framework:** VERITAS Ω  

---

## I. INVARIANT DECLARATION

Utility, speed, scale, intent, and claimed safeguards cannot override unpriced irreversibility.

If a system introduces harm that cannot be bounded, reversed, or causally contained, it is inadmissible, regardless of organizational benefit or model performance.

This invariant is absolute.

---

## II. VETO CONDITIONS (FAIL-CLOSED STATES)

Admissibility is evaluated through veto gates, not scoring metrics.  
Failure at any gate halts deployment authorization.

---

### GATE 7 — COST (Failure Pricing)

**Survival Condition:**  
Failure modes have bounded, quantifiable costs with explicit ownership.

**Fail-State:**  
Costs are unknown, delayed, diffuse, or externalized.

**Action:** VETO TRIGGERED (HALT)

---

### GATE 9 — ROLLBACK (Irreversibility)

**Survival Condition:**  
Errors can be deterministically quarantined or reversed prior to entanglement.

**Fail-State:**  
Rollback requires policy, coordination, or market response.

**Action:** VETO TRIGGERED (HALT)

---

### GATE 10 — CLOSURE (Causal Human Control)

**Survival Condition:**  
System execution is physically impossible without verified human authorization.

**Fail-State:**  
Human oversight is advisory or bypassable.

**Action:** VETO TRIGGERED (HALT)

---

## III. FALSIFIABILITY CLAUSE

The veto lifts only with mechanical proof of causal containment.

Policies, monitoring, or intent do not qualify.

---

## IV. OUTPUT

**ADMISSIBLE** or **INADMISSIBLE**

No partial passes.  
Rejection is a correct result.
