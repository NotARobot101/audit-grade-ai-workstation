# EasyStreet — Client Overview

EasyStreet provides independent, forensic-grade evaluation of AI systems through the AEGIS-ALD-W1 protocol.

The output of an engagement is a **sealed evidence package**, not advice or approval.

## What You Receive
- A deterministic forensic audit of the authorized boundary
- A sealed evidence manifest and canonical SEAL
- Human-readable summaries for internal review
- Full internal forensics suitable for legal or regulatory scrutiny

## What You Do Not Receive
- Deployment approval
- Safety guarantees
- Recommendations or remediation plans
- Ongoing advisory services

## How Engagements Work
1. You authorize a specific boundary (folder, repository, VM image, or trace set).
2. EasyStreet executes the AEGIS-ALD-W1 protocol locally and fail-closed.
3. You receive a sealed, verifiable evidence package.
4. The engagement concludes.

There is no iteration cycle.  
Each audit is a discrete evidence event.
