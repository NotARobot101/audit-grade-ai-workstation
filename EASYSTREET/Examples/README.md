## Example Decision Payload

This directory contains a single, illustrative example of the input payload
provided to EasyStreet prior to receipt generation.

The payload demonstrates:
- how decisions are scoped,
- how evidence is supplied,
- how human authorization is recorded.

This example does NOT:
- evaluate the decision,
- assert correctness or compliance,
- represent a real deployment.

EasyStreet treats this payload as opaque input.
All files are sealed verbatim into cryptographic receipts.
