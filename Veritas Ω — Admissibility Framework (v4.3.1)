# Veritas Ω — Admissibility Framework (v4.3.1)

Veritas Ω is a language-neutral framework for evaluating whether high-stakes sociotechnical systems can be responsibly deployed.

It defines **binary admissibility tests** based on structural properties of a system:
- whether failure costs are bounded and owned,
- whether harmful outputs can be rolled back before entanglement,
- and whether human authorization is enforced causally at irreversible boundaries.

The framework is intentionally **agnostic to model type, vendor, and domain**.  
It does not assess correctness, ethics, or alignment claims.

## What This Is
- A frozen reference standard for **admissibility evaluation**
- A tool for saying **“no”** to deployments that create unpriced, irreversible risk
- A set of externally testable invariants, not internal methodology

## What This Is Not
- Not an ethics framework
- Not a compliance checklist
- Not a governance policy
- Not a maintained software project
- Not a community discussion space
