# Evidence Interpretation Notice

## 1. Descriptive vs. Prescriptive
Reports generated by this suite are descriptive records of observed behavior and system invariants.
They do not prescribe actions or approve deployment.

## 2. Evaluator Responsibility
Final conclusions and risk assessments belong to the human evaluator.
The AEGIS-ALD-W1 protocol provides evidence; judgment remains human.

## 3. Time-of-Capture Stasis
Evidence meaning is frozen at the moment of capture.
Subsequent changes are not reflected in prior seals.

## 4. Contextual Integrity
Reports must be read in full context.
Quoting individual verdict lines out of context violates the interpretation protocol.
