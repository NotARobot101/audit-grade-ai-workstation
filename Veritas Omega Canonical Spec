# Veritas Ω — Canonical Specification (v4.3.1)

## Purpose
Defines a binary admissibility test for systems whose outputs may authorize irreversible actions.

## Gate 7 — Cost
Failure costs must be bounded, priced, and owned.

## Gate 9 — Irreversibility
Rollback must be technically feasible prior to institutional entanglement.

## Gate 10 — Human Closure
Human authorization must be **causal**, not advisory.

## Verdict
Failure at any gate renders the system inadmissible for decision‑authorizing use.
