## Audit-Grade Evaluation of RAG Reset Robustness

This repository contains a short methodology appendix describing a deterministic framework
to test whether common reset procedures in retrieval-augmented LLM systems
(thread isolation, context flushing, cooldowns) return the system to a clean behavioral state.

**Key observation:**  
Across controlled runs, lexical residue appears only after ingestion of untrusted retrieved
content and survives reset mechanisms assumed to neutralize prior influence.

This repo intentionally omits prompts, payloads, and vendor-specific details.
The PDF below documents the measurement approach and hardware constraints.
